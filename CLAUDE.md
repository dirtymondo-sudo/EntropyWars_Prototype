# CLAUDE.md

Entropy Wars — a browser Tactical-JRPG PvP prototype. `server.js` (Express +
socket.io) is only matchmaking/relay; ALL gameplay logic is client-side in
`index.html` + ~35 scripts loaded from a Cloudflare R2 bucket (custom domain
`cdn.entropywars.net`, brotli + long-cache edge) and CDNs.

## RULE #1 — DELIVERY WORKFLOW (do this, nothing else)
The game loads its scripts from the R2 bucket, NOT from the repo and NOT from a
local server. So Claude CANNOT make changes go live. The ONLY correct workflow:
1. Edit the ACTUAL existing files in the repo in place (never create new GAME
   .js files, never split game logic into a new module — work with what's
   already there; that rule protects the fixed R2 upload set. Repo-only dev
   tooling at the repo root (check-*.js, *.test.js, deploy.js, load-data.js)
   is fine and expected — see TOOLING).
2. Hand the user the COMPLETE edited file(s) in the chat (SendUserFile).
3. The user uploads them to the R2 bucket (and manually syncs the repo so future
   sessions start from the latest) — or runs `npm run deploy` (see TOOLING),
   which uploads + cache-busts in one command.
DO NOT `git commit`, DO NOT `git push` (it 403s anyway), DO NOT generate patches/
diffs. The deliverable is always the full edited file, produced in chat.

### TOOLING (added 2026-07-29 — run `npm test` before delivering ANY file)
- `npm test` — zero-dependency (Node 22 built-in runner): syntax-checks every
  repo JS, validates data.js content schemas (races/spells/abilities/classes),
  and diffs the hand-synced server.js economy copy against data.js (this
  caught real drift on day one: `swordfighter` missing from the server's
  AVAILABLE_RACES). A server-boot smoke test runs when node_modules exists.
  OPTIONAL: .github/workflows/ci.yml runs the same suite on every push
  (must live at exactly that path — GitHub ignores workflows elsewhere).
- `npm run test:parity` / `npm run test:syntax` — the individual checks.
  ANY edit to the ACCT_* constants / starter lists / race lists in data.js or
  server.js MUST pass test:parity. Since 2026-07-29 the server RUNTIME derives
  these from data.js at boot (server.js `ECON` object, headless load via
  load-data.js), but the server literals remain the boot-failure fallback AND
  the parity tool's extraction target — keep them synced, and keep them as
  plain `const NAME = <literal>` declarations (extraction is source-text based).
- `npm run deploy` — USER-run (needs wrangler auth + EW_R2_BUCKET env): finds
  the changed R2 files (git status, explicit args, or `--all`), node --checks
  them, bumps the `?v=` token in index.html, uploads via wrangler, and prints
  the Render-redeploy reminder. `--dry-run` previews. Without a bucket it
  still bumps the token and prints a manual upload checklist. Claude has no
  wrangler creds — Claude's deliverable is still files in chat (RULE #1);
  this script is how the USER ships them.
- `load-data.js` — loads data.js headlessly in a Node vm sandbox (real
  values, not a copy). Use it for any new data validation/tooling instead of
  regex-scraping data.js.
- `migrations/*.sql` (added 2026-07-29) — versioned D1 schema, applied at
  boot by server.js `runMigrations` (recorded in `schema_migrations`;
  duplicate-column/already-exists errors are tolerated so it converges on
  the pre-existing live DB). Schema changes = a NEW `NNN_*.sql` file, never
  ad-hoc ALTERs in code. Account tokens are SHA-256-hashed at rest since
  2026-07-29 (`players.token_hash`; plaintext column holds a `'#'+hash`
  tombstone, legacy rows are backfilled at boot — all lookups MUST go
  through server.js `findPlayerByToken`). HTTP endpoints are per-IP
  rate-limited (`httpRateLimit`). Production checklist: set
  `EW_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on Render so arbitrary sites can't open sockets.

### RULE #1c — DO NOT PLAYTEST UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED
Playtesting (Playwright runs, browser automation, driving the game) burns a LOT
of the user's tokens and they are fully capable of testing themselves. After
making changes: syntax-check the edited JS (`node --check <file>`) and hand the
files over — that's it. Only run the playtest harness / any browser automation
when the user explicitly requests it (e.g. "playtest <mode>") or when a change
is genuinely impossible to validate any other way AND the user has agreed.

### RULE #1b — CACHE-BUSTING (MANDATORY on EVERY R2 file delivery)
Assets are served with immutable long-cache headers, so an uploaded file does
NOTHING until `index.html`'s version token changes — players keep the cached old
copy otherwise. Therefore: **whenever you deliver ANY R2-hosted file (.js/.css/
asset) in chat, you MUST also bump the `?v=` token in `index.html` and deliver
the updated `index.html` in the SAME message.** No exceptions — one R2 file
changed ⇒ ship a fresh index.html too.
- Bump = one global find/replace of the current token to a new unique one:
  `sed -i 's/?v=<OLD>/?v=<NEW>/g' index.html`  (e.g. `20260705a` → `20260705b`,
  or a fresh date). The token is shared across every URL, so one bump
  invalidates everything — that's intended. KEEP any suffix after the date+rev
  (the current tokens end in `-cors` — that part is load-bearing).
  `npm run deploy` / `node deploy.js` does this bump automatically.
- `index.html` is served by Render (NOT R2); the user redeploys it to Render.
  It must stay revalidated (short/no cache), so the new token is seen immediately.
- Asset URLs *inside* the JS (sprites/textures/audio/GLB in sprites.js `_S`,
  audio.js `_R2_BASE`, inline data.js/three-renderer.js URLs) are NOT yet
  `?v=`-tagged. If you change an asset in place, either rename its file (new path
  = auto cache-bust) or tell the user, since the token bump won't cover it.

## RULE #2 — ONLINE PVP PARITY (every gameplay/visual change MUST work online)
Online is host-authoritative: the HOST runs the entire engine (blitz turns, AI
auto-play, damage, banners, camera); the GUEST is a dumb mirror that only (a)
applies `state-sync` snapshots and (b) replays `relay` events it's explicitly
sent (online.js). **Anything that happens engine-side — a banner, a camera move,
a VFX, floating text — simply does not exist for the guest unless it is relayed.**
That's why online kept drifting behind VS-CPU. So, for EVERY change:
- New on-screen moment (banner/announce/VFX/camera)? Wrap the global fn in
  online.js like `showTurnBanner`/`showPlayerTurnAnnounce`/
  `playOffensiveActionCamera`: host `_emit('relay', {type: ...})`, plus a guest
  handler in the `socket.on('relay')` dispatcher. Relay ALL opts that change
  behavior (dropping `noActionCam` is how guests got cinematics on basic attacks).
- New `state.*` field the guest needs? Check `_serializeState`'s skip list.
  New UI-only field? ADD it to the skip list + `_guestUIKeys` if guest-local.
- New player action? Guest must EMIT it (engine-wrapper pattern, see
  `doEntropyStrike`/`doBuildAction`), never execute locally.
- Fog is ENFORCED online. Any camera pan / select / text keyed to an ENEMY unit
  must gate on screen-true visibility: `_shouldCameraFollowUnit` /
  `_isTileVisibleToViewer` (both use the fog renderer's `computeVisibleTiles`
  set — do NOT reintroduce flat awr-radius checks, they see through walls and
  leak positions to the opponent).
- Before delivering, ask: "what does PLAYER 2 (guest) see when this fires?"
  If the answer is "nothing" and it's player-facing, it's not done.

## DOOR docs (story + headquarters) — read before ANY DOOR / story / hub work
- `DOOR_MASTER.md` — the single DOOR file: Part A canon (world, factions,
  ranks L1–L6, departments → rooms, arena objectives ↔ engine), Part B
  integration layer (what's shipped where), Part C reconciliation decisions
  (some awaiting the user's yes/no), Part D build log. APPEND to Part D on
  every DOOR session. `DOOR_DESIGN.md` and `entropy_wars_claude_brief.md`
  are stubs — don't resurrect them.
- `DOOR_HQ_BUILD_PLAN.md` — the phased plan for the headquarters hub that
  replaces the Play menu (pre-rendered rooms + DOM hotspots first; the MD
  Guild Hub free-roam tech is the later walkable path). Has the file
  placement per RULE #1, the room-graph data shape, the door-state rules,
  and the reference-art protocol (`docs/door-hq/ref/` in the repo —
  Claude can view images committed there; production backgrounds go to R2
  `Assets/door/hq/`). Append to its §9 build log when you touch the HQ.
- The HQ SHIPPED 2026-09-03 (three-renderer.js `ThreeRenderer.hq`, data.js
  `DOOR_HQ`, map.js `_hqEnter`) and since Phase 1.3 the main menu's **Play
  enters it** (`_goToPlayHub`); every screen's Back / the result overlay
  return to it via `_hqReturnOrMenu`; bay doors launch VS-CPU crossings
  through `_hqLaunchMission` → `window._hqPreselect` (match-select) +
  `window._hqCpuPool` (state.js). Classic hub: `?nohq`, localStorage
  `ew_hq='off'`, or Settings → D.O.O.R. Headquarters. Dev entries:
  `index.html?hq`, `window._hqEnter()`. Kit assets live on R2 under
  `Assets/door/models/` + `Assets/door/textures/`; reference art is in the
  repo at `door_reference_images/`. `npm test` runs `doorhq.test.js`.
  Playtest harnesses call `_goToVsCpu()` directly and bypass the building.
  **The ROOM REGISTER (HQ plan Phase 7.1, shipped 2026-09-07)**: every site
  and numbered HQ room wears ONE `roomNo` (a string; `i`, `2D`, `H-20` are
  legal) — on `DOOR_HQ.thresholds[mapId]`, on a room, on a department
  door, or in `DOOR_HQ.facility` (64 / 404). Read it ONLY through
  `hqRoomNo(idOrMapId)` / `hqDoorNo(entry)`; `hqRoomRegister()` lists
  every numbered place sorted. doorhq.test.js fails on a shared number, a
  launch map without one, or a door that duplicates its room's number.
  Adding a site = a `roomNo` + `why` on its threshold (plan 7.3 has the
  number; 7.10 the checklist).
  **SEVEN BAYS + THE CONTAINMENT RING (plan 7.5 + 5.4a, shipped
  2026-09-07 / stage 2 2026-09-08)**: `DOOR_HQ.sectors` has seven bays
  (Bay 7 · URBAN on the mezzanine at 180°). Since 5.4a stage 2 the bays
  of one egress floor are ONE room: `bayShell.corridor` (`on`, `rings`
  per level with rIn/rOut just outside the egress drum, `endPadM`,
  `gapM`, `arc` override, `close`) → `hqRingLayout(level)` (each bay a
  SEGMENT: its egress door on the inner wall at the SAME angle as on the
  egress, its thresholds a `spacing` run on the outer wall centred on it,
  runs relaxed apart, the break at the widest gap) → `hqRingRoom(level)`
  (`rooms.ring_g` / `ring_m`, still `kind: 'bay'`; `segments`,
  `shell.full`). READ the room through `hqBayId(sector)` (→ the floor's
  ring) and land through `hqBayEntry(sector)` (→ `egress_<sector>`) —
  never hard-code `'egress'` or `bay_<sector>` for a bay; `hqBayNo
  (sector)` for its number (no room wears `bayNo` any more);
  `hqRingSectorAt(room, deg)` names the bay you stand in (map.js uses it
  for the overheard lines); `hqRingSpot(sector, spot)` carries a
  bay-frame prop / cast spot into the ring (Sedaniel). The caps wear the
  stage-1 fire door to EACH OTHER (`{ room: ring, at: cap_* }`). The
  stage-1 rooms (`hqBayRoom` → `bay_<sector>`, cap doors via
  `hqBayRing` into the neighbour bay, `_hqCapWall`) stay registered and
  come back with `corridor.on: false`; `bayShell.ring: false` kills both
  stages. Moving a map between bays = edit `sectors` only — everything
  else derives. doorhq.test.js checks the layout (no door overlaps,
  every launch map once on the rings, the segments, the caps).
  **THE WALKABLE SITE (plan 7.2 stage 1, shipped 2026-09-07)**: a site
  listed in `DOOR_HQ.siteRooms.built` (since stage 6, 2026-09-08 rev 4,
  ALL 29 launch maps — doorhq.test.js insists every threshold id is
  built; the first were `prebuilt_dumb`, `prebuilt_cern`,
  `prebuilt_backrooms` — stage 2 shipped 2026-09-07 — then the OUTDOOR
  rooms `prebuilt_nuketown`, `prebuilt_stadium` — stage 3 shipped
  2026-09-08: `shells[id].open: true` = no ceiling, the walls are
  the site's perimeter in battle TERRAIN keys (`_hqTex` falls through to
  the terrain sheet), an `apron` / `skirt` past them, lamp MASTS at the
  walkway corners, and `shell.sky` = the map's EW_MAP_META `env` drawn by
  three-renderer.js `_hqBuildSky` — a second firmament dome on the
  battle's shared `_envUni` uniforms, driven by `_hqTickSky`, plus the
  map's far roster hung round the room from the same builders; the
  battle's own horizon is untouched) is a ROOM
  behind its bay threshold — `hqSiteRoom(mapId)` (data.js) generates a
  box room (`kind: 'box', fx: 'site', site: mapId`; never hand-edit
  `rooms.site_*`) with the site's Δ board on the floor at 1:1, read by
  `hqSiteBoardInfo(mapId)` and drawn by three-renderer.js
  `_hqBuildSiteBoard` (instanced cell quads / raised boxes / pits /
  edge-wall slabs / `_monBuilders` monuments / the nexus ring — never the
  battle mesher). Walking = `_hqSurface`'s board layer (`_hq.site`,
  `_hqSiteCellAt`): +1 climbed, +2 a wall, water waded, lava never. The
  bay threshold walks you in (map.js `_hqDoorDirectAction`); the CROSSING
  console (`overlay: 'crossing'`, `_hqCrossingHtml`) files the crossing
  and is where post-match returns you. The room wears NO `roomNo`
  (`hqRoomNo(roomId)` → the threshold's). Adding a site room = one id in
  `siteRooms.built` (+ `shells[id]` / `flavour[id]`); doorhq.test.js
  checks it. Natives stand at `npcSpots` with a `race` hint. **THE MOAT
  ROOMS (stage 4, shipped 2026-09-08 rev 2: `prebuilt_camelot`,
  `_atlantis`, `_hell`, `_technoticlan`, `_agartha`, `_antarctica`)**:
  `shells[id].moat = { key, gap, bank, bed, deck, causeways }` on an open
  room makes the walkway a QUAY (`pad` = quay + gap) and sinks the ring
  round the board one level, full of the map's liquid — `hqSiteRoom` →
  `shell.moat` (+ `walk` / `tint` / `quay` derived); the renderer draws
  it in the battle's own fluid sheet (`_buildFluidTopMat`, ticked by
  `_hqTickMoat`), the walker gets it as a pseudo-cell from `_hqSiteCellAt`
  (`_hqSiteOnCauseway` = the deck), board-edge lakes of the same liquid
  open into it. A site room's floor is a FRAME (box shell `siteHole`)
  so pits show. Adding a moat room = `open` + `pad: 5` + `moat` on the
  shell; the test checks the quay ≥ 2 m, the liquid, the tint, and that
  no prop / native / mast stands in the water. **THE SETTING IN THE
  ROOM (stage 5, shipped 2026-09-08 rev 3)**: every site room runs its
  map's MAP SETTINGS near builder (`_NR_BUILDERS[meta.near]`) inside
  itself at 1:1 — `DOOR_HQ.siteRooms.near[key] = { w, h?, stands? }`
  (`w` MUST equal the builder's `_nrKit` `w`; doorhq.test.js diffs the
  renderer source), `hqSiteRoom` grows `pad` to `w × tile + the moat's
  gap` and hands the renderer `shell.near`; three-renderer.js
  `_hqBuildSetting` runs the builder with `ctx.hq` (`_nrKit` takes the
  room's w / gap / base / tints; `_nrApron` / `_nrMoat` / `_nrRoom` /
  `_nrSign` are no-ops under `K.hq` — the shell is those), culls pieces
  that double the perimeter or stand in the way in / at the console,
  makes every other piece a blocker, and `_hqSettingFreeSpot` nudges
  natives + floor props off them. A console off the west wall =
  `shells[id].console = { wall: 'n'|'e', at }`; `stands: true` moves the
  natives / boxes / chair to the n/s strips; flavour props keep their
  distance to the wall when the room grows (`flavour[id].fitted: true`
  = already placed). Kill-switch `window.EW_HQ_NO_SETTING`. A site can
  opt OUT of its setting (`shells[id].setting: false` + a plain `pad`
  — Flat Lands, whose builder's apron is fourteen tiles). **Adding a
  site room today = `built` + `shells[id]` + a `near` row (`w` = the
  builder's) + `flavour[id]`; nothing in the renderer.** A room's
  LIGHT is `shells[id].mood` (lamp / glow / strip / light colours, the two
  sign palettes, optional `signLines`) merged over `siteRooms.shell.mood`
  (= D.U.M.B.'s red); the renderer's signs and lamps hang from `S.h`.
- **The CAST shipped 2026-09-06**: the story's named characters (the user's
  cast sheet, canon, `DOOR_STORY.md` §2 / DOOR_MASTER A16) stand in the
  building. Models: sprites.js `DOOR_CAST_MODELS` (15 rigged GLBs on R2
  `Assets/Sprites/Races/maincharacters/`, `_mkCast`, the `_CAST_POSES`
  library slots — sit/talk/phone/fold-arms/kneel-fix/push/reach/crouch).
  Placement: data.js `DOOR_CAST` (spots per room, pose, talk radius,
  weights; `hqCastInRoom`), spawned by three-renderer.js `_hqSpawnCast`,
  panel in map.js. The HQ avatar is the Player model (`EW_HQ_AVATAR =
  'vessel'` restores the most-played vessel; `EW_DISABLE_CAST` removes the
  cast). Cast LINES are user-authored (A15 rule) — Claude writes only the
  `doing` stage directions. Adding a cast member = one `_mkCast` line +
  one `DOOR_CAST` entry; `npm test` (doorhq.test.js) checks both sides.
  Placement is screenshot-driven: `node playtest_hq.js <room> [force-json]`
  (repo tooling; needs the server + `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`) — see
  PLAYTEST_NOTES "THE CAST IN THE HEADQUARTERS" before moving anyone.

## MAP SETTINGS (near scenery) — added 2026-09-06
Every Δ board is dressed like the Training Room: a NEAR builder builds the
board's immediate surroundings (apron/plateau, moats, walls, buildings, trees,
props) in three-renderer.js `_NR_BUILDERS` ("MAP SETTINGS" block, right before
`_HZ_NEAR_BUILDERS`), keyed by `near: '<key>'` on the map's EW_MAP_META row
(data.js; folded into the Δ preset env → `state.mapEnv.near`). The far
floating roster (`env.scenery`) is untouched. Use the `_nr*` kit (apron,
moat, wall ring, room, blocks, trees, fence, lamps, props…) — never new
files. Enclosures opt into the line-of-sight fade with `occ:true`. Screenshot
any board with `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 node playtest_maps.js <map…>` (repo
tooling; see PLAYTEST_NOTES "MAP SETTINGS"). Kill-switch:
`window.EW_NO_FACILITY_SCENERY`.

## THE CROSSING (opening cinematic) — added 2026-09-06
The match intro (battle.js `playOpeningCinematic` + three-renderer.js
`introCineStart/_introBuildDoor/_introUpdateDoors`) no longer marches teams up
a staircase (the MAP SETTINGS aprons buried it). Each team files through a
freestanding D.O.O.R. threshold standing on the setting's apron outside its
spawn lane (past the moat): the leaf is the map's own `DOOR_HQ.thresholds`
catalogue door (data.js; `_delta` stripped from the mode id, else the `near`
key, else `leaf_closet_alt`), buzzed open / stamped shut with the DOOR sound
kit, dissolved at the cross-map push. Units are hidden "on the other side"
until their turn (walk-tween `_holdHidden`). The near kit publishes the apron
facts in `_nrLastKit` (apron top, level `B`, moat gap) — a board with no
setting gets a floating landing instead. Loading screen pre-warms the leaf
(`introCineWarm`). Lone doors also float in every far roster (`_hzLoneDoor`,
monument key `door`). Kill-switch unchanged: `window.EW_DISABLE_INTRO_CINE`.
Camera framing for beats 1–2 is anchored on `info[p].doorOut`/`zB` (battle.js
`doorLift`) — tune those two numbers before touching the renderer.

## THE MAIN MENU SCENE (the lone door in the open) — added 2026-09-08
The main menu's black void is a PLACE: three-renderer.js `ThreeRenderer.menu`
(`_menuEnter/_menuLeave/_menuBuild`, right after `_hqApi`) is a self-contained
scene on the SHARED renderer — same contract as the HQ — re-parented into
`#menuStage` (index.html, first child of `#mainMenuPage`) by map.js
`_menuSceneEnter` (called from `_showTitlePage` for `mainMenuPage`; every
other page calls `_menuSceneLeave`). ONE crossing door stands ~65% across
the frame (right of the text column) in the middle of a desert or out on
the Antarctic ice, the Sedan (the honda civic's static car GLB) is parked
off to the side with its headlights on the door, the site's own sky + far
roster (`_hqBuildSky(room, Hx)` / `_hqTickSky(now, Hx)` now take a target
record) hang round it, the page's CSS motes drift over it, and a scrim
(`.void-menu.menu-3d .menu-stage::after`, styles-base.css) keeps the left
column readable. The door IS the match door: `_introBuildDoor` (the
crossing's threshold builder — frame, seal, case line, catalogue leaf —
the leaf is a PLAIN door, `leaf_hollow_core`, per the user) on a flat kit
at y=0; `_MENU_BIOMES` (renderer) holds every framing number (camAt /
lookAt / doorAt / doorYaw / sedanAt / sedanYaw / cineDist / cineSide /
cineLookOff in METRES, the leaf key, the floor terrain key, the far
roster, `lightMul`) — tune those, not the code. **The camera looks down
+Z, so SCREEN-RIGHT IS WORLD −X** (the door stands at x = −2.6 to land
right of frame — the first cut mirrored it). The door stands SHUT on a
fresh arrival from the title (`enterGameFromTitle` → `menu.reset()`);
ENTER on the menu (ui.js keydown → map.js `_menuSceneEnterKey`) plays
THE ENTER BEAT — `menu.playEnter()`: the camera pushes to cineDist m in
front of the door (`_MENU_CINE` keyframes: push 1.7 s, the buzz + swing
at 0.8 s, hold 1.1 s, pull 1.9 s), the leaf swings open with the light
behind it, then the pull back out with the door left open; ENTER again
shuts it (the stamp). The "⏎ ENTER · THE DOOR" hint (`#menuEnterHint`)
shows while it stands shut (`onState` callback). Screenshot it with
`NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 node playtest_menu.js desert|antarctica [tag]`
(repo tooling; `EW_MENU_CINE_SCALE` stretches the beat so a ~1 fps
software-GL run can photograph it — see PLAYTEST_NOTES "THE MAIN MENU
SCENE"). Built once per session and kept across visits;
`menu.dispose()` drops it (the Settings biome button rebuilds). Off = the
classic void: `?nomenu3d`, localStorage `ew_menu3d='off'` (Settings → Main
Menu Scene), `window.EW_NO_MENU_SCENE`; `EW_MENU_BIOME` / `?menubiome=` /
localStorage `ew_menu_biome` pick desert / antarctica (else a coin toss per
load); `EW_MENU_NO_POST` = bare render. Entering parks a post-match battle
renderer (same guard as `_hqEnter`) and refuses over a live battle or the
building (map.js leaves a suspended HQ first). Fixed on the way: a HOT
crossing leaf (introCineWarm) landed synchronously before its group was
parented, so `_introBuildDoor`'s fit ran on `g.parent` = null and bailed —
the guard is now `rec.dead` (set by `_introDropDoors`). doorhq.test.js
source-scans the signatures.

## THE TERMINAL (the match-select screen is a console's CRT) — added 2026-09-08
Match-select is DIEGETIC: match-select.js renders a full-frame CRT monitor
(`.ms-crt` bezel → glass → screen, scanlines, the phosphor's warm black;
CSS in styles-base.css "THE TERMINAL" block, `.ms-tty-*` = the terminal
typography) in two homes and two VARIANTS. Homes: `#hqTerminal` inside
`#hqPage` (map.js `_hqOpenTerminal(spec)` — the building waits underneath,
paused via `_hqSuspend`; three-renderer.js `hq.focusScreen({ counterId })`
pushes the camera onto the desk's `crt_terminal` prop (found by catalogue
key in `_hq.props`, +Z-front, `hq.unfocus(ms)` pulls it back; the avatar
hides under the push) and the overlay powers on 430 ms in (`.on` =
`msCrtOn`, `crtOn` SFX); `#modePage` = the classic route (`?nohq`,
VS CPU from the play hub) — the same monitor on black, `frame: 'page'`.
Variants (`_mountReactMatchSelect({ host, variant, frame, pre })`): **SITE**
(`pre.locked`) = the site is the room you stand in — site file, then BOARD
(Δ 8×8 ↔ the full site, `pickBoard`), GAME MODE (Clash excluded — it is
pinned to its own stage; Gauntlet on full boards only), TEAM, ROUNDS, CPU
TEMPO, FILE THE CROSSING; **FULL** = MODE · every SITE (cards, filters,
optional `pre.presets` chips) · CONFIG. Who opens what (map.js
`_hqInteractTarget` → `_hqConsoleTerminal`): a walkable site's CROSSING
console → SITE for `room.site` (sealed / gated sites keep their panel);
the Training Room's RANGE console → FULL with ORIENTATION / PRACTICE
presets (`_hqRangeTerminal`; the facility boards have NO Δ cut — launchId
is the site); DISPATCH's panel → "THE DESK'S SCREEN" (`data-terminal`,
`_hqDeskTerminal`) → FULL, bare pre; a bay threshold's CROSS / DEEP /
RESPOND (`_hqLaunchMission`) → SITE over the paused ring, no push. The
launch contract is unchanged: `_msSelected*` mirrored during render,
`window._hqPreselect` (+ `locked`, `presets`) read by `_msConfirm`, the
CPU pool pinned only while the filed map is the pre-selected site. FILE →
`_msConfirm` → `_hqTerminalClose({ launch: true })` drops the overlay and
`_hqLeave`s (the match owns the canvas next; the return spot is the
console — `doorId` → `_hqLastDoor`). STEP AWAY / ESC → `_hqTerminalClose()`
→ power-down (`.off`, `vhsEject`), `unfocus(560)`, `_hqResume`. `_msBack`
/ `_msConfirm` / the walker's `onEscape` check `_hqTerm` first; `_hqLeave`
and `_hqEnter` drop a screen left up. **THE DEAD-CURSOR FIX that came with
it**: `requestPointerLock` is async — closing a panel un-paused the walk,
which re-requested the lock, and the grab landed AFTER `_hqLeave` on the
match-select page. Now `_hqUnbindInput` exits the lock unconditionally and
stamps `_hqLockStaleAt`; a document `pointerlockchange` listener
(`_hqOnLockChange`) releases any lock that lands while the walk is PAUSED
or within 2.5 s of a leave; panels on the way to a launch close with
`_hqClosePanel({ keepPaused: true })`. `npm test` (doorhq.test.js "the
terminal") source-scans all of it. Fallback: no host / no React → the old
panel + the page.

## THE FORGE TERMINAL (party builder redesign) — Stage 1 SHIPPED 2026-09-09
`PARTY_BUILDER_PLAN.md` is the staged plan for rebuilding party-builder.js
around the seven reference images in `party_builder_references/` (view
them with the Read tool): ONE CRT monitor (the match-select `.ms-crt`
chrome), four tabs (ROSTER = the champ-select wall · TECHNIQUES = the
three-pillar circuit + the technique panel · GEAR · DOSSIER), the party as a
ROW of circular portraits along the bottom, stats as pills, passives as
sticky notes ON THE BEZEL, and the hero playing its real cast animation +
VFX on the stage when a spell is hovered / equipped. Read the plan's §2
(anatomy: mount points, `EWCharViewer`, the cast chain, the VFX binding —
`ThreeVFX.init` is single-scene and online.js RELAYS `VFX3D.fire`, so a
preview must route around it), §3 (the rounding rule and the other design
rules), §5 (the six stages, in order), §6 (decisions the user still owns)
before touching the builder; append to its §9 build log every session.
**Stage 1 shipped (2026-09-09)**: party-builder.js renders the monitor —
root `.ms-crt.ms-crt-page.ms-crt-forge.pb-tarot` → bezel → glass →
`.ms-tty.pb-tty` (head · `.pb-tabbar` · `.pb-body[data-tab]` · `.pb-party`
· `.pb-foot`); `PB_TABS` (`window.PB_TABS`, `window._pbSetTab(id)`), React
state `pbTab`, ROSTER first, `pickRace` flips to TECHNIQUES; Q / E, [ / ],
1–4, ← →, ESC (closes a window, else BACK). The STAGE (`.pb-stage`, one
keyed element) never remounts across tabs — `EWCharViewer` is a singleton.
Windows (`PbWindow`, module-level — a per-render component remounts on
every keystroke) replace the modals; the standalone locker is `.pb-locker`.
CSS = styles-base.css "THE FORGE TERMINAL" block (`#builderOverlay` is
positioned there because the CRT root is absolute). `npm test` runs
`party-builder.test.js` (source scans: tabs, root, row, one stage, the
lock-flow names, the mechanic names). Every mechanic kept its function name
(plan rule 3.5) — re-skin, never re-implement.
**Stage 2 shipped (2026-09-09)**: TECHNIQUES is THE CIRCUIT —
`SpellTreePanel` (same name, same `TREE_NODE_POS`, same rules) draws
round-capped `<path>` connectors, 50 px chips (capstones 58 px in a
`.pb-node-crown` ring), pillar-head PILLS in their own strip
(`.pb-circuit` = heads · board · pips), a gold halo on `techSel`; the
TECHNIQUE PANEL (`TechniquePanel`, `.pb-technique`, fed by
`pbTechInfo`) follows `techHover || techSel` and its verb (`techVerb`)
does what the chip click does. Keys on TECHNIQUES: arrows walk the
circuit (`treeStepKey`; SHIFT+← → = the party row), ENTER = verb,
BACKSPACE = unequip, SPACE = replay. THE MOVE PREVIEW: three-renderer.js
`_castChainFor(kind)` / `_attackChainFor(kind)` are the ONE chain table
(the board's cast + attack sites call them — never inline a chain
again); `EWCharViewer` keeps the whole library bake and exposes
`play(slotOrChain, { full, name })`, `playSpell(spell, { attack, full })`
(`classifySpellAnimKind` → the chain; a basic attack → the def's
`basicAttackKind`), `stopPreview`, `isPlaying`, `hasClips`, `onState(fn)`.
The builder's `pbPreview(sp, { hover })` fires it (hover / keyboard =
180 ms debounce, idle only; click / equip = immediately) and the stage
wears `.pb-stage-pill` (`MOVE PREVIEW · name`, `NO PREVIEW · SPRITE
VESSEL`, `PREVIEW OFF`). Kill-switches: `state.animationsDisabled`,
`window.EW_NO_PB_PREVIEW`. The party row is sized by
`.pb-party { --pb-portrait }` (96 / 76 / 64 px by breakpoint).
**Stage 3 shipped (2026-09-09)**: the spell LIGHTS UP the stage — a click /
equip / ENTER / ▶ on a technique runs `EWCharViewer.previewSpell` (hover
stays animation-only, C-10): the viewer borrows the battle's VFX layer
through `ThreeVFX.attach(v.vfxGroup)` (the pools re-parented; a stage
opened before the first match initialises them and the board's
`init(scene)` ADOPTS them; `detach()` clears and sends them home) and
`VFX3D.stage.enter/exit/fire` (three-vfx-effects.js `_VS`: the stage cfg,
flat ground, `_suppressed` ignores the phase, `_post` → a shim,
`_shake` / `_LT()` / `_geom3D` route every board shake / lightning /
geometry read — **never add a bare `window.shakeBoard(` /
`ThreeLightning.` / `_spell3DGeometry[` to that file again**;
`stage.fire` is the INTERNAL fire, never the online-wrapped one). The beat:
turn to +X, windup, the clip, burst + the mapped intents at 45 % ((2,0) =
two tiles to screen-right, aura at the hero), finish. The monitor reacts
through `onStageFx` → `data-grade` (the type's ENTROPY STRIKE colour),
`.pb-crt-roll-on`, `.pb-crt-jolt`. Kill-switches: `EW_NO_PB_VFX` (Stage
2's animation-only preview), `EW_PB_VFX_NO_GEOM`, `EW_NO_PB_PREVIEW`.
**Stage 4 shipped (2026-09-09, rev 5)**: ROSTER is THE WALL — `.pb-rtile`
tiles (portrait full-bleed else the sprite, faction ring, type dots, ★, 🔒),
round filters (`.pb-type-disc` ×6 `PB_TYPE_GLYPH`, `.pb-faction-ring` ×3,
search pill, SORT / JOB pills → `PbWindow` menus — no native `<select>` on
the wall), hover → the stage shows that vessel (`rosterHoverIn`, 220 ms;
`stageRace` etc. feed `HeroViewer3D`). Same rev: the row's OVAL portraits
fixed (the legacy `.pb-party-slot` height clamp at styles-base.css ~3467 is
overridden in the forge block — never delete that override), the VFX plays
on HOVER too (C-10 overruled by the user), and THE MOVE + THE FRAME
(three-renderer.js `_cvMovePlan` / `_cvMoveTo` / `v.frameTo`): a charge
RUNS to the tile beside its dummy at (3,0) and strikes on arrival, a dash
slides its line, a teleport blinks, a melee swing lunges, and `_cvFrame`
pulls the camera out to hold the whole beat (`VFX3D.stage.caster(x, y)`
moves the effects' caster anchor with the hero). Two instance bugs fixed:
`PartyBuilder(props)` reads `props.standalone` (the module flag was shared
by the sleeping pre-match instance) and the key handler acts only for the
instance on screen; match-select.js's ENTER / ESC listener returns while
its host is off screen. Screenshot the forge with `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1
node playtest_builder.js [tag]` (repo tooling; standalone route; GLBs do
not load in the sandbox — DOM / CSS only). Next: Stage 5 (sticky notes,
stat pills, affinities, GEAR, DOSSIER).

## TRAINING MATCH (instant CPU turns vs a human) — added 2026-09-07
Match-select → CONFIG column → **CPU TEMPO: Cinematic / ⚡ Training**
(match-select.js, sticky via localStorage `ew_training_match`; mirrored into
map.js `_msTraining` → `_msConfirm` sets `state.trainingMatch`). The human
plays P1 normally; whenever a CPU-controlled unit becomes the active blitz
unit, battle.js `_syncTrainingTurbo` (called from `_continueBlitzWithUnit_impl`)
flips `state._aiTurbo` on: `_skipVisuals()` → true, camera + animations
forced off (restored from `_preTurboVisualPrefs`), `getDevSimSpeedMultiplier`
→ `TRAINING_TURBO_MULT` (64), `_waitForAnimationsThen` tight poll, AI
telegraph/activation delays zeroed, SFX muted (audio.js). It's cleared for
the human's units, at the end-of-round sequence, in `finalizeMatch` and at
match start. Floating damage numbers are NOT visual-gated so the CPU's hits
still pop. Other launch paths (campaign, MD, spell lab, `_selectMode` labs)
reset `state.trainingMatch = false`; online never turbos (skip-listed in
online.js). Renderer/VFX gates that used to read only
`devAutoSim && !_devSimShowAnims` now also honour `state._aiTurbo`
(three-renderer.js `actionGlowStart`, three-vfx-effects.js timers, state.js
storm lightning). Blitz-turn modes only — Simul has no per-side turn.
**Imitation (same session):** in a training match the CPU LEARNS from the
human. At each human doMove/doAttack/doSpell/doGuard, battle.js
`_imitObserve` calls ai.js `window.aiScoreMargin(unit, action)` — which
runs the CPU's own ranking (`rankCandidates`, now shared with `aiTakeTurn`)
for that unit, finds the human's action among the candidates (a move the
scorer never proposed is scored synthetically: joint move×action value −
tile danger) and returns human − CPU-best score margin. On a disagreement
a random subset of `AI_WEIGHT_DEFAULTS` keys is probed by finite
differences (`_aiWeightProbe` override in `getAIWeight`) and each key that
closes the gap steps 2% of its range, clamped, into `_aiTrainedWeights`
(the same champion table the A/B lab tunes; persisted via saveAIWeights).
Match-end log line summarises; `window._ewImitationSnapshot()` for numbers;
`EW_AI_DEBUG` logs each disagreement; kill-switch `EW_NO_IMITATION`.
Stats key `ai-imitation-stats-v<schema>`. Reset = Training panel → Reset.
The match-end REPORT is a persistent panel (`#imitReportPanel`, created by
battle.js `_imitShowReport`, z-index above the result overlay) with Export
JSON / Copy / Close; it hides on `hideResultOverlay` and at the next match
start; `window._ewImitationReport()` reopens the last one. (Also fixed
2026-09-07: the Arena victory tally zipped P1/P2 detail rows by index and
crashed `showResultOverlay` when only one side had a Bounties row.)

## ENTROPY STRIKE — THE SIX APOCALYPSES (typed team attack) — added 2026-09-07
The full-gauge team attack is no longer typeless: the ⚛ ENTROPY row on the
bezel now OPENS a picker (hud.js `_hrlgEntropyBlades`, `actionMenuView ===
'entropy'`, gated in ui.js `chooseActionMenu`) with one row per damage
type — **For All Mankind** (human) · **Invasion Day** (alien) ·
**Revelations** (divine) · **Hell on Earth** (unholy) · **Robot Uprising**
(tech) · **Reality Shift** (anomaly). Catalogue: data.js
`ENTROPY_STRIKE_TYPES` / `ENTROPY_STRIKE_TYPE_ORDER` (also on `window`);
read it through battle.js `getEntropyStrikeType(id)`. Damage: `doEntropyStrike
(unit, strikeType)` passes the type as `spellType` to applyDamageToUnit, so the
TYPE_CHART judges every victim (weak ×1.30 / resist ×0.75 + the trigger's
STAB) — no element layer. `getEntropyStrikeForecast(unit, type)` (weak /
resist / neutral counts, avg mult, stab) feeds the picker's intel chips and
`getEntropyStrikeBestType(unit)` (the AI's pick, ai.js `scoreEntropyStrike`
→ `strikeType` on the candidate; also the default for any caller that omits
the type). Presentation: `_ewsPlayCinematic` is a shared skeleton (typed
banner `.ews-t-<id>` in styles-cinematic.css, splitscreen charge, crane,
per-enemy camera beats, restore) that delegates every beat to the type's
DIRECTOR in `_EWS_DIRECTORS` (siren / pane / world / enemyCam / lead /
strike / resolve + FIXED chargeMs/staggerMs/resolveMs). Directors use the
CineFX kit (cineGrade, cineInsert — new kinds k-stamp / k-signal /
k-scripture / k-terminal / k-glitch — cineFreezeFrame, cineSlowMo,
cineDollyZoom, the named shots) and the VoidStage (`opts.maxMs` added so
the ultimate holds the void through every strike; scarcity gate bypassed
on purpose). RELAY RULE: VFX that online.js relays by itself
(sigUFOFleet3D, spawnProbeDescent3D, tileGlow) fire only when
`!ctx.relayed`; the DOOR synth kit (`playDoorSfx`) is NOT relayed so both
screens voice it. Online: `strikeType` rides the `doEntropyStrike`
game-action and the `entropy-cine` relay; Simul plan steps carry it too.
`npm test` runs `entropy-strike.test.js` (catalogue ↔ directors ↔ CSS).

## ARENA RULES — fixed Key pool + round safety cap — added 2026-09-07
Arena (state.js `MULTIPLAYER_MODES.arena`) scatters a FIXED pool of
`keySpawnCount` (5) Keys and wins THRESHOLD STABILIZED when one team CARRIES
`keysToWin` (3) at once; `roundLimit` is 100 — a safety cap only (composite
Arena score, then Sudden Death), because a match must end on a real win
condition (AI training / balancing wants every objective live, comebacks
included; a tighter cap returns later). Read the numbers ONLY through
battle.js `getArenaKeyRules(mp)` / `getKeysToWin(mp)` — modes without the
two fields keep the legacy "carry every Key on the board" rule and the map's
`CONFIG.winHourglasses`. A fixed pool never restocks (the round-10
`spawnPeriodicHourglasses` top-up is skipped). `state.hourglassTarget` is set
at spawn for ai.js `assessWinCondition` and syncs to the guest. HUD tower
block shows `🗝 held/needed`. See PLAYTEST_NOTES "ARENA RULES PASS".

## THE PASSIVE BATCH (CHAMP_REWORK_PLAN Phase 3) — added 2026-09-07
Every §5.2 passive is a `PASSIVE_DEFS` row (data.js) whose HOOK FIELDS the
engine reads through `unitPassiveValue(unit, key)` — never the race. The
header comment above `PASSIVE_DEFS` lists every field and its consumer; plan
§5.7 has the per-passive table. Rules that came with it: `getEffectiveRange
(unit, opts)` — pass `{ item: true }` for thrown-item reach (Longshot is
basic-attack only); `applyStatStageBoost(…, { perm: true })` makes a
permanent ledger entry (`statStageMods[i].perm`, skipped by the tick, the
badge timer and buff purges; death resets it); `unitCryptidHiddenFrom` rides
`isUnitConcealedFrom` (renderer + AI + nameplate eye) and is gated again in
`doAttack` / unit-targeted `doSpell`; `_applyRoundStartPassives()` runs
before EVERY `buildBlitzTurnOrder()` (Lycanthropy's `wolfForm` carrier, Mad
Genius); `buildBlitzTurnOrder` tiers by `getEffectiveSpd` (stages reorder
initiative) and Quickdraw heads its tier. New status fields: `healTakenMult`
(applyHealingToUnit), `magicDamageTakenMult` (applyDamageToUnit, magic only).
Adding a passive = one `PASSIVE_DEFS` row + one `RACE_PASSIVES` id + a
`PASSIVE_VALUE` price in check-grades.js; `npm test` (champ-rework.test.js)
fails on a missing def, a slot overflow (flying counts), an unpriced id, or a
`PLANNED_PASSIVE_ALLOWANCE` row for a race that already wears its passive.

## THE STATUS BATCH (CHAMP_REWORK_PLAN Phase 4) — added 2026-09-07
Every §5.1 status is a `STATUS_DEFS` row (data.js, the Phase 4 block after
`wolfForm`; its header comment lists every hook field → consumer). The
engine reads FIELDS, never ids: `countsAs` (bonusStatusMatches — Corroded
is Burn AND Poison), `blockSpells` (`unitSpellsBlocked` — the ONLY
silence gate; never call `unitHasStatus(u,'silence')` at a cast site),
`rangeDelta` (getEffectiveRange, generic), `basicAttackStatus`
(Incendiary), `hpMaxMult` + `onApply`/`onRemove` (Monstrous; the hooks
fire from applyStatusPayload / clearStatus — `onRemove` runs BEFORE the key
is deleted), `grantsFlight` (map.js canFly + `levitateUnit` /
forceGroundUnit), `shedMotes` (finishMoveAt → dropPixieDust, blind on
step), `linkEcho` (`_procLinks` after every damage application; partner
ids ride the PAYLOAD: `partnerId` / `allyId`), `dragDamagePerTile`
(`_tetherFollow` in finishMoveAt), `fear` (`_fearFleeMove` at the
victim's activation), `realm` (`isUnitRealmShieldedFrom` — target /
damage / heal / status gates). state.js `getNextBlitzUnit` skips ANY
status with blockMove + blockAction (stun, frozen, Stoneform). Adding a
status = one row + `STATUS_LIBRARY_DESCS` + `_STATUS_EFFECT_IDS` +
`_HRLG_SB_COLORS` (+ ai.js `HARD_CC` / data.js `_MF_*` if it denies
turns); champ-rework.test.js fails on a missing registry. §5.6 RULE: a
non-capstone `statStageBoost` is ±1 (ring-3 capstones ±2; Calcify −2) —
the test enforces it. Possessed / Infected are rows only until the
`possess` kind (Phase 5 wave B) wires `getControllingPlayer`.

## TWIN NODES (race-tree nodes that hold two spells) — added 2026-09-07
CHAMP_REWORK_PLAN §4 / §4.6 (Phase 2). A `RACE_TREE` entry (data.js) may be
a 2-id array: the node holds two ALTERNATES, exactly one equips (1 slot,
the node's ring cost + tier), the other is a free respec. Read rows only
through `getRaceTreeRow` (pairs intact) / `getRaceTreeSpells` (faces =
first alternate, the flat shape every legacy caller expects) /
`getRaceTreeAlts` (`{ R3: [a, b] }`) / `getRaceTreeAllIds`. A unit's
tree (`buildUnitSpellTree(race, cls, sec, equippedIds)`) resolves each twin
node to its equipped alternate else its face and exposes `tree.alts`; ALWAYS
pass the equipped ids so the node wears the right spell. `isTreeLoadoutLegal`
rejects both alternates at once, `treeLegalSubset` keeps the first,
`buildTreeLegalLoadout` rebuilds the tree per pick. Builder: ⇄ badge on the
chip, "⇄ other" under the name, one picker overlay shared with the
Freelancer sockets (`twinPick` / `flSocketPick`), swap-in-place via
`twinCandidate`. Saves unchanged (flat `customSpells`); online host
validation already funnels through `treeLegalSubset`. Adding a twin = one
row edit + `npm test` (content-schema.test.js checks the shape, tiers,
one-alternate rule, repair and random walks).

## PHASE 5 WAVE A (CHAMP_REWORK_PLAN §5.9) — added 2026-09-08
The first spell wave: 16 new `RACE_ABILITIES` rows on their §6 twin nodes
(QB Sneak, Transform, Snowball Volley, White Christmas, Ice Shard,
Incendiary Rounds, Grave Chill, Tail Whip `raceDinoTailWhip`, Apex Roar,
Treeline Retreat, Stoneform, Piercing Arrow, Freeze Breath, Sky Tackle,
Cluster Rockets, Plasma Cannon), renames with ids kept (Stampede, Arrow
Volley, Heat Vision, Flat Earth), Perch Form deleted. New kinds:
**`transform`** (battle.js `doSpell` branch toggles the `carForm` /
`mechaForm` carriers at 99 rounds; the model rides `UNIT_ANIM_OVERRIDES
[race].formSprites` via `unitStanceForm` / `_formSpriteFor`, which the
apply/revert sprite beats honour) and **`tackle`** (the damage branch +
`_runPostEffects`: carry `pushDistance` down the charge line, caster lands
one tile behind, `collisionBonus` / `collisionStatus` on a wall or body).
New flags the engine reads: `executeBelowPct` (`_applyExecuteRider`, also
on the delayed Take Aim record → state.js), `onKillHealPct` /
`onKillRefundAp` (`_applyOnKillRiders`), `lineWidth` 2–3
(`getLineSpellLaneOffsets` — `_applyLineDamage`, ray footprint, direction
preview), linePush `collisionBonus` / `collisionStatus` /
`collisionStatusBoth`, `terrainDeform.flatten` (+ `radius`), zoneDebuff
`expireTerrain`, STATUS `spellRangeDelta` (`getEffectiveSpellRange`).
Fixes that came with it: `damage`-kind `pushDistance` and escape-kind
`statusEffects` were never applied (now they are — plan §10 #27). Adding
a wave-B/C spell = data row + tree node + a `SPELL_MAP['<id>']` family
alias in three-vfx-effects.js + a `WAVE_A`-style row in
champ-rework.test.js; a new KIND also needs `SPELL_KIND_META`, a `doSpell`
branch, ai.js `scoreSpell` + `findSpellTarget`, hud.js parts, ui.js
`_SLB_KINDS`. `npm test` guards all of it.

## PHASE 5 WAVE B (CHAMP_REWORK_PLAN §5.10) — added 2026-09-08
Control + links: ten rows on ghost / zombie / demon / shaman / vampire /
succubus and five kinds. **`possess`** (Possession, Enthrall, Infect,
Thrall Bite): battle.js `possessUnit` applies the control status and
FLIPS `unit.player` to the caster's seat (`_origPlayer` = home) — every
`unit.player` consumer (HUD gate, `runComputerTurn`, fog, targeting, the
online guest-emit gate) hands the body over with no special cases;
data.js `_releaseControl` (the statuses' `onRemove`) and battle.js
`releasePossession` (map.js `defeatUnit` calls it) hand it back;
`maybeAdvanceTurn` spends one activation per controlled turn;
`showPossessedActivation` opens the turn (relayed as
`possessed-activation`). Read `getControllingPlayer(unit)` /
`unitHomePlayer(unit)`, never `_origPlayer` directly. **`link`** (Soul
Bind, Voodoo) and **`transfer`** (Sacrifice) are the first TWO-CLICK
casts: `SPELL_KIND_META.twoClick`, the first legal click is remembered in
`state._spellPick1` `{ id, spellId, x, y }` (nothing spent; the gate sits
right before doSpell's commit point), the second resolves; the drum /
prompt / hud chip follow `_twoClickPick(spell)`; `clearSpellPick()` on
cancel / ESC / turn end; online the guest picks locally and its second
click carries `partnerId` (host dispatcher seats it); `_spellPick1` is
skip-listed + guest-local; the AI stashes the partner in
`_aiPairPick[spell.id]` and the executor seats it. **`shadowRealm`**
(Shadow Realm★) crosses `partnerId` on both, director
`CINE_SEQUENCES.raceShadowRealm` = the `shadow` Void palette (+ css
`vp-shadow`). **`cannibalize`** is corpse-targeted through
`spellTargetsCorpses(spell)` (raiseDead OR meta `corpseTarget`) — use it,
never `kind === 'raiseDead'`. Adding a possess / link spell = a data row
+ tree node + `SPELL_MAP` alias + a `WAVE_B` test row; `npm test` guards
the kinds, the seat flip, the two-click gate and the relay.

## PHASE 5 WAVE C (CHAMP_REWORK_PLAN §5.11) — added 2026-09-08
Summons, tethers, terrain: eighteen rows on cowboy / mad scientist / black
goo / fairy / ghoul / atlantean / dragon. **`summonUnit`** (Whistle's Hound,
Summon Creation): a WALKING TURRET in `state.turrets` (`summon: <key>`,
`hitsToKill`, `move`, `reveals`, `armored`; `summonDef` on the row) — the
raiseDead zombie's template, so fog / `damageTurretAt` (now takes
`opts.damageType`; armored = physical hits count half) / the renderer
(`_buildSummon3D`) / the HUD nameplate / state-sync come free;
`processTurretVolleys`' walker branch hunts the owner's ENEMIES only, reveals
Invisible within `reveals` first, walks `move` tiles, strikes adjacent with
`sourceUnit` = the caster. **Goo terrain = the existing `swamp` Black Ooze
row** (never add a `goo` key): `enterStatus` (finishMoveAt) + a
`{ type: 'status' }` endTurn result (map.js applyTerrainTurnEffects) Goo
whoever touches it; **timed painting** through battle.js
`_paintTimedTerrain(cx, cy, { terrain, radius, rounds }, unit, label)` →
`state._timedTerrain` (prev terrain remembered, reverted by
`_tickTimedTerrain` at the top of processEndOfRoundZonesAndSeeds) — used by
`paintTerrain` on damage (`_runPostEffects`) / barrage rows and by Oozing's
`trailTerrain`. Flags the engine reads: `lineZone` (`_applyLineDamage` →
radius-0 `_activeZones` entries; every `zone.radius || 1` became `?? 1`),
`onlyTerrain` on a teleport (`getTeleportTerrainTiles`, gate + ui.js
highlight + AI), `statusFirst` (status before the hit), `purgeBuffs`
(`removeBuffs`). The `pull` branch now applies `spell.statusEffects` (it
never did) — Lasso is the rope (`tethered` 2). Tsunami★ took Great Flood's
r4 seat (Flood stays authored, off-tree). Adding a summon = a row with
`kind: 'summonUnit'` + `summonDef { key, name, move, dmg, hits, reveals?,
armored? }` + a `_buildSummon3D` look for a new key; `npm test`
(champ-rework.test.js "Phase 5 wave C" ×3) guards the rows, the terrain
plumbing and every engine site.

## PHASE 6 — THE TWO NEW RACES (CHAMP_REWORK_PLAN §5.12) — added 2026-09-08
The last phase of the champ rework: **gangster** (Gunslinger, `shank`;
Stomp Out → Drive-By ⇄ Hit a Lick → Choppa → Extended Clips★) and **nun**
(White Mage, `devout`; Purify ⇄ Smite → Blessing → Prayer → Hallelujah★)
are real races — 98 in `AVAILABLE_RACES`, in every race table on BOTH
sides (server.js `AVAILABLE_RACES` + `ACCT_STARTER_UNITS` literals; `npm
run test:parity`). The nun is her OWN race: `RACE_PROFILES.priest
.labelFemale` is 'Priestess' (same whitemage female model, shared by
`RACE_MODELS_3D.priest.female` and `.nun.female`), the Nun's user-authored
`DOOR_ROSTER_LINES` sit under `'nun'` (moved, never rewritten), she is a
starter. The gangster has NO rigged model — `RACE_SPRITE_GENDERS` male,
the 2D sheet borrows the Gunslinger folder — so `isRace3DReady` shelves
him for players until the owner uploads one (then one `_mkUAL` line +
the starter lists). New kinds (battle.js `SPELL_KIND_META` + `doSpell`):
**`steal`** (the hit, then `_stealFromUnit` moves `stealKeys` Keys +
`stealItems` items — Plunder keeps its utility id) and **`cleanseArea`**
(3×3 tile cast: allies lose every `kind: 'debuff'` key via `clearStatus`,
enemies lose every buff via `removeBuffs`; nothing applied). A `dash` may
wear **`afterShot { dmg, range }`**: after the slide, `_afterShotTarget`
(weakest visible enemy in LOS of the landing tile) takes the bullet; a
`dmg: 0` dash only shoves. ai.js scores/targets all three; hud.js parts,
ui.js `_SLB_KINDS` / AoE preview, data.js `SIM_DEFAULTS` know the kinds.
check-grades.js `PLANNED_PASSIVE_ALLOWANCE` is EMPTY now — a future
planned passive goes back in as `race: value`. Adding a race = the §5.12
table list (data.js ×15, sprites.js ×5, server.js ×2, lore ×2) and the
Heat Death ladder's top tier (`ACH_CATALOG` champsMastered = roster
size; achievements.test.js pins it). `npm test` (champ-rework.test.js
"Phase 6" ×3) guards every table and engine site.

## Most common request: "playtest <mode>"
The user wants Claude to **actually play Player 1 against the CPU** (NOT auto-sim /
dev-sim — they can do that themselves) and report pain points: unresponsive
clicks, getting stuck, confusing UI, bad pacing, plus the bug classes in
PLAYTEST_NOTES.md. There is a ready-made harness — don't rebuild it:

```bash
npm install && npm start            # server on :3000 (background it)
# first time only:
npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
node playtest.js tdm                # arena | tdm | clash | simul | gauntlet
```

It drives the real menus → starts a VS-CPU match → plays P1 with real tactics and
spells → flags bugs → writes screenshots + combat log + `<mode>-flags.json` to
`shots/`. Read the console output and the artifacts, then summarize findings.

**Read `PLAYTEST_NOTES.md` first** — it has the full menu flow, the `window.GAME`
API (blitz turn model, move/attack/spell calls), and prior findings. That file is
the anti-"start over" memory; keep it updated when you learn something new.

## Wiring up a 3D character (frequent request)
Units can render as rigged Meshy GLB models instead of sprites. Since
2026-07-10 animations come from SHARED libraries on R2 (`Assets/Models/`):
Quaternius `UAL1_Standard.glb` + `UAL2_Standard.glb` (non-root-motion), and
since 2026-07-11 `MAL1_Sniper.glb` — the 20 Meshy animations exported ONCE
from the male sniper, consolidated offline into a 1.4MB animation-only GLB.
three-renderer.js retargets all of them onto every Meshy rig at load, so
per-character animation exports are no longer needed; Meshy-sourced
libraries retarget exactly like UAL ones (_libEnsureSrc auto-detects rig
naming). To grow the library: download animations for ONE character, then
consolidate (strip meshes/textures, merge clips named by file stem — see
PLAYTEST_NOTES "MAL library"). Retargeting
keeps each character's OWN rest posture (hunched beasts stay hunched; only
arm bind angles are standardized), and per-character clip flavor is one
`lib: {slot: {clip, lib, ts}}` opt (see UAL_SLOTS + PLAYTEST_NOTES). Recipe:
1. The user uploads the rigged model `..._Character_output.glb` (or any
   `_withSkin` export) to the race's R2 sprite folder. The
   `_generate`/`_texture` stage GLBs are BONELESS — never use them.
2. Add ONE line in sprites.js RACE_MODELS_3D:
   `'<race>': { male: _mkUAL('<folder>', '<meshy file prefix>', { heightRatio: 1.0 }) }`
   — done. Slot→clip map + timescales live in `UAL_SLOTS` (sprites.js);
   heightRatio is relative to the male fortune teller (=1.0). The renderer
   measures true SKINNED bounds for scaling — don't compensate manually.
3. Optional 128×128 `portrait.png` in the same folder + a `RACE_PORTRAITS`
   entry → shows in HUD panels/turn clock instead of the map sprite.
4. Verify a GLB before wiring (rigged? boneless?): parse its JSON chunk with a
   node script (see PLAYTEST_NOTES.md "Rigged 3D unit models").
5. Deliverable: hand the edited sprites.js back via chat (RULE #1).
Legacy path: per-character Meshy `..._Animation_<Name>_withSkin.glb` clips
(must be exported FROM that character — direct cross-character playback warps
the mesh) still wire via `_mk3d(folder, prefix, {slot: Clip})` and are the
automatic fallback when the library fails or a def sets `noAnimLib: true`.
Kill-switches (console): `window.EW_DISABLE_3D_UNITS = true` (all 3D),
`window.EW_DISABLE_ANIM_LIB = true` (library → per-character Meshy clips).

## Key facts
- Server: `npm start` → http://localhost:3000.
- External assets load behind TLS inspection → Playwright needs
  `ignoreHTTPSErrors:true` and `--use-gl=swiftshader` (already in playtest.js).
- Turn model is blitz (`GAME.state._blitzActiveUnitId`); the engine auto-plays AI
  (P2) units and waits when a local P1 unit is active.
- TDM/FFA score is `state.matchKills`, NOT `state.matchScores`.

## Conventions
- Don't run auto-sim/dev-sim for playtesting — play P1 manually.
- `node_modules/`, `package-lock.json`, `shots/` are gitignored; commit code + docs.
- Dev branch: `claude/great-cray-5OS8X`. NOTE: in this environment BOTH `git push`
  and the GitHub API/MCP return 403 for the agent — Claude cannot write to the repo.
  To persist new files, hand them to the user (SendUserFile) to upload via GitHub
  manually. Don't waste time retrying pushes.
